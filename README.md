temp files for running in NS1 while I learn Javascript

rootworm.script was directly copied from this link:

kudos to FireGamer99 for the code in this script. I tried to modify it to return an array of all the rooted servers but was unable to due to the script already using a return in the unique() function. I will be rewriting it in NS2 soonâ„¢ to use with my much more functional scripts in the main branch.
